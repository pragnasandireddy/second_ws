</h3>
<p>Before getting into the details of how to go about building a rooftop garden, let’s look at a few reasons that will inspire you to get growing your roof garden:

    What’s better than the fresh supply of home-grown veggies and fruits every day from your garden. Organic vegetables and fruits are more nutritious than the ones we buy from food markets and are great for your health.  
    
    
    Imagine the hot soup that you prepare using the fresh vegetables from your garden. Mouthwatering and full of nutrition. 
    
    
    The food that we source from markets and grocery stores are usually grown with the help of chemical fertilizers. This chemical then seeps into your food system and can eventually lead to health hazards. Growing your own food will help you ensure the good quality of food that you consume on the daily basis.
    
   <h4> Ace Your Space</h4>
    Building a terrace garden helps in keeping your home cool, it is great for the people living in tropical areas. All the plants growing on your terrace will create a micro-environment and will lower the temperature of the place. So while you enjoy the wholesome home-grown food you also save up on big bills from ACs.
    
    <h4>Reduces Your Carbon Footprint</h4>
    By building a garden at your home you will help the environment and reduce your carbon footprint. The plants that you grow will improve air quality. Farming done using chemical materials deteriorates the soil quality and pollutes air and water.
